                                    <article>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a
                                          domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is
                                          derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the
                                          dog's nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be
                                          domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the
                                          development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs
                                          have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the
                                          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
                                          canids.[11]

                                          The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
                                          sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in
                                          shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
                                          herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
                                          companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs
                                          became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been
                                          a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them
                                          the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[1</article>

                                    <article>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog
                                          were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic,
                                          and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.[20] The
                                          dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a
                                          woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under
                                          large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper.[21] Earlier
                                          remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic
                                          dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated[22] because
                                          considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late
                                          Pleistocene.[1]

                                          This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be
                                          domesticated[9][8] in the time of hunter–gatherers,[7] which predates
                                          agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a
                                          common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which
                                          was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.[6][7] Most dogs form a sister group
                                          to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the Kesslerloch [de] cave
                                          near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to
                                          14,500 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be
                                          from 32,100 years ago.[23] This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene
                                          wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[8][1][24] with the modern wolf
                                          being the dog's nearest living relative.[8]

                                          The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a
                                          commensal pathway into domestication.[22][25] The questions of when and where
                                          dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for
                                          decades.[9] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over
                                          25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the
                                          high Arctic, or eastern Asia.[10] In 2021, a literature review of the current
                                          evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by
                                          ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and
                                          westward across Eurasia.[20]
