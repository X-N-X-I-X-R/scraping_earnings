                    <strong>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It
                        has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end
                        of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
                        prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of
                        a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
                        preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some
                        lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do
                        not actively seek out and prey on humans.

                        The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other
                        wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the
                        Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India,
                        but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in
                        western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
                        populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion
                        populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline
                        is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for
                        concern.

                        One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively
                        depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and
                        literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been
                        a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th
                        century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have
                        occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current
                        range.

                    <strong>The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related
                        individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a "pride". Groups of male lions are
                        called "coalitions".[85] Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate
                        outside females.[86] The majority of females remain in their birth prides while all males and
                        some females will disperse.[87] The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several
                        adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up
                        to 30 individuals, have been observed.[88] The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion
                        pride that always has just one adult male.[89] Prides act as fissionâ€“fusion societies, and
                        members will split into subgroups which keep in contact with roars.[90]

                        Nomadic lions range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone.[85] Pairs are
                        more frequent among related males. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and
                        vice versa.[91] Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride
                        females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them.[92] Males spend years in a nomadic phase
                        before gaining residence in a pride.[93] A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park
                        revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age.[94] In
                        Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal
                        pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride.
                        Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the
                        same area.[95]

                        The evolution of sociability in lions was likely driven both by high population density and the
                        clumped resources of savannah habitats. The larger the pride, the more high-quality territory
                        they can defend; "hotspots" being near river confluences, where the cats have better access to
                        water, prey and shelter (via vegetation).[96][97] The area occupied by a pride is called a
                        "pride area" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a "range".[85] Males associated with a pride
                        patrol the fringes.[46] Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male
                        lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. Some
                        individuals consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.[98] Lions
                        tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable
                        services to the group.[99] Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader
                        that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these
                        responses.[100] The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with
                        the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them.[91] Dominance hierarchies do not
                        appear to exist among individuals of either sex in a pride.[101]

                        Asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate
                        with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other
                        females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only
                        when mating.[102] Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. Males
                        in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male
                        dominates the others and mates more frequently.[103]<strong </div>
