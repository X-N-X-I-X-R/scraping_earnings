            <article>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven
              gill
              slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are
              classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and
              kin). Some sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of
              Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like
              chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419-359 Ma),
              though
              some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458-444 Ma).[1] The oldest
              modern sharks (selachians) are known from the Early Jurassic, about 200 Ma.

              Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species that is
              only
              17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world,
              which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.[2] They are found in all seas and are common to
              depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few
              known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be found in both seawater and
              freshwater.[3] Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and
              parasites
              in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.[4]

              Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain. Select
              examples include the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and
              hammerhead
              shark.

              Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark populations are threatened by
              human
              activities. Since 1970, shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.[5]</article>

            <article>The oldest total-group chondrichthyans, known as acanthodians or "spiny sharks", appeared during
              the Early Silurian, around 439 million years ago.[11] The oldest confirmed members of Elasmobranchii sensu
              lato (the group containing all cartilaginous fish more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to
              chimaeras) appeared during the Devonian.[12] The oldest representatives of Neoselachii, the group
              containing modern sharks (Selachii) and rays (Batoidea) to the exclusion of most extinct elasmobranch
              groups, date to the Permian.[13][14] Selachiimorpha and Batoidea are suggested to have diverged during the
              Triassic.[15] The oldest modern sharks date to the Early Jurassic, with most modern orders appearing by
              the end of the Jurassic.[16] Selachians largely replaced the hybodonts, which had previously been dominant
